    "*This program reads in the BAM file, and looks at the distribution of bases at each position of all UMIs\n",
    "for a cell barcode. It detects unusual distributions of base frequency, where a base with >=80%\n",
    "frequency at any position is detected as an error. Barcodes with less than 25 total UMIs are ignored.\n",
    "There are a number of different errors that are categorized:*\n",
    "\n",
    "*- **SYNTHESIS_MISSING_BASE** - 1 or more bases missing from cell barcode, resulting in fixed T’s\n",
    "at the end of UMIs. This counts the maximum number of fixed sequential T’s in the UMIs at\n",
    "the end. This error type is cleaned up by the software for situations where there is a single\n",
    "base missing, and is by far the most common error. The fix involves inserting an “N” base\n",
    "before the last cell barcode base, effectively shifting the reading frame back to where it\n",
    "should be. This will both collapse these beads back together in further analysis, as well as\n",
    "repair the UMIs for these bead barcodes.*\n",
    "\n",

    "*- **SINGLE_UMI_ERROR** - At each position of the UMIs, the base distribution is highly skewed, i.e.\n",
    "at each position, a single base appears in >= 80% of the UMIs for that cell. There’s no fix for\n",
    "this currently. Cell barcodes with this property are dropped. These cells have the interesting\n",
    "property that the number of genes and transcripts are at a close to 1:1 ratio, as there’s\n",
    "generally only 1 UMI for every gene.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*- **PRIMER_MATCH** - Same as SINGLE_UMI_ERROR, but in addition the UMI perfectly matches\n",
    "one of the PCR primers. These cell barcodes are dropped. These errors are only detected if a\n",
    "PRIMER_SEQUENCE argument is supplied.*\n",
    "\n",
